Kevin Patrick Joseph McAllorum
Born: 7/26/1967
In Mercy Hospital in Baltimore 2 months too early.  
Bubble Boy.
Double Hernia at Birth
Died at the age of 7 briefly from Penicillin during tonsil surgery
I was close to my Mom's Mom and my Mom.
My Father and I are well never going to see eye to eye.
Father was abusive to me verbally and emotionally always and at times physically
when i was a junior in high school my family moved to norcross GA.
I stayed with my Mom's mom - my grandmother ... Dee Dee in Towson when the family moved to GA.  
Once i graduated in 1985 i spent a week in Ocean City, MD with my girlfriend and then drove to GA and started College.  My girlfriend came with me to college in Atlanta, GA.
After 6 years of dating Michele we broke up.  I went my messed up way and she continued in college.  
I ran away at age of 17.
I live with a bunch of friends.  My father came one night and stole my car.  So i ignored him.  And went and bought my own.
Living with him was a nightmare that i just could not take.

My mother got cancer when i was 18 and i came back home to help take care of her
we moved back to baldwin md.  Built a house and mom went into remission.  And once again, now 21 i could not take it so i moved out to my own apartment and got promoted at AT&T.  i was a District Special Project Manager writing code in pascal, fortran, informix, c, lu6.2, and cobol.  Starting Unix System Administration.  I had worked in the Labs as computer tech during Freshman and sophmore college before dropping out.
I also worked as computer lab assistant in high school with Unix and Punch Cards.
When i was 23 i met and dated a girl Meg.  We went to Florida to disney world where she informed me she was married.  And we flew home and went to ocean city where she left me for a friend and so i went home.  She and I played around for a bit but she started to drink a lot and it became uncomfortable that she was sleeping around and not the right person for me.  I tried a blind date but had the firl at my apartment when my cousin came by they ended up togather leaving me alone.  I talked with my old girlfriend she was in Delaware as a bank manager after graduating from the college in Atlanta. 
Work folks setup this bowling outing, we were all to go bowling.  I showed up and Leala Mullen Showed up.  I knew her from the office, we had met in 1989.  This bowling outing was in December of 1990. 
June 21, 1991 I married Leala.
August of 1991 i was told to pick a state by AT&T that i wanted to work in, Orlandao, FLA, Piscataway NJ or Atlanta GA.  Since i already had lived in Atlanta i knew i could afford that.
So we traveled a few times back and forth and settle on a house... AT&T is going to put up down payment and the moving expenses.  So the movers come and Lea and I are on the floor with blank pillow and phone.  Dad calls, Mom died.
The world for me stopped.
The one parent i loved, my best friend, my mother had passed away in her sleep.  The movers on the their way to GA to meet us after we close on the house tomorrow.  I had to make a lot of calls.  Postpone the move, Postpone the house, Postpone my work, Postpone Lea's work.  

So we spent Tues to Saturday after Funeral in Baldwin MD. 
The funeral was so Hard for me... I could hardly stand, could hardly breath.  The one person in the world i knew i could always talk to always lean on was gone.
i had been married not even 5 months.  And I lost my job and had to transfer.  I am buying a home in another state, I am leaving everything i know behind.  And the person i relied on the most died.
i go numb.  I wake daily and go thru motions.  Worried about every sore, every cut, is it cancer like Mom's.  Finally Lea leaves me  in feb 1995.  
We remain really good friends but I spend 5 years alone. going to strip clubs, hanging out with questionable folks.  Studying all types of computer stuff and read a lot.  
Dec 1991.  My Online dating ad gets a hit, Michelle Nowak.  She lives around the corner with her mom and dad and daughter.
In Aug of 2000, Michelle and I and Kimber(michelle's daughter) move into a house together and start a common law marriage.  
Over the years i look into annulment with Leala, but i never do it.
I do contact Lea, and we talk but we never annul. She is on Ohio and I am in Flowery Branch.  Michelle and I fight a lot because she cheats a lot.  and her whole family lives with us.  So it's uncomfortable because i am always looked at as crazy.  
May of 2012, common law abolished, Michelle Leaves... Leaves her whole family with me and she goes and marries another guy. 
I am devastated.  I talk with Lea every day crying trying to make sense of life.  I am in a wheelchair from hip issues and have no way of really solving this issue.  I don't want the house, I don't want her family with me, I just want out.
I meet Charlotte through a dating app in early october, I invite her for Thanksfiving.  And She comes, Just before she comes i get a call about my Grandma Dee Dee .. She's not doing well.  We have Thanksgiving in 2012 at my house.  Dec 2nd
Dee Dee passes.  I arrange to go to Baltimore and bring Charlotte with me on Train.  I leave Gainseville, GA.. Charlotte gets on in Greenville, SC.  WE go to Baltimore for 3 days.  Well after funeral i meet up with friends and plan a lot more so we stay a few more days.  Talk to Lea on speaker phone about everything.  She meets Charlotte via phone. 
Here i am sick, my Grandma i just watched go in the ground and i am facing going home to where i dont want to be.  So on the way home, I get off in greenville and don't go home.
In March 2013, I move in with Charlotte giving keys back on house.
Leala calls and asks me to come back to her in Ohio.  I am not going to Ohio.
I stay with Charlotte, and issues come up through out the years.  But we marry and i take her to Ireland, where she SLEEPS THE WHOLE DAMN TIME.
so not doing that again.
well as you can see marriage to charlotte involved watching her cheat.
She had this money scheme going where she would use my card to pay for her mom's stuff then her mom would pay her back and she pocketed that money.. I found a bank receipt for an account for 45K.  after she ran off with a romance scam.
So in 2022 She left.  I filed for divorce feb 2023.  SC separated for a year before you can divorce... It's a prison sentence you stay in your home, not date, not go out...etc. etc.. The moment i got legally separated though i went to Ohio to visit my ex-wife and best friend.  I made a plan to move their and well be wit her and help her.
See she went back to her husband after attempt of suicide after cancer.  She is a cancer survivor.  
Paul her husband had cancer so she stayed in guest room there and on floor of master bedroom till finally getting a bed, but he was dying.  So i moved to an apartment in Sept of 2023.  Because i was still married could not buy a house but build one i was doing.  I was building Honey Farm Way.  But the stairs were really hurting  me.  I lived there from March till September when i said enough.  I had not seen the upstairs in a month.  My legs hurt. 
So i decided market was heavy enough.  I'll build and sell.  Well it did not sell.
But i built. and In April of 2025 i moved to windcliff dr east.
across the pond.
i see honey farm from my back porch.
And now it's Jan 2026.  On Market since March of 2025.  No longer rented just sitting empty is honey farm way.

Lea and I remarried in June of 2025.


So time Frames
Leala Dec 1989 to Feb of 1995 dating then Married.
Michelle Dec 1999 to Mary of 2012.  Dating the common law married then nothing.
Charlotte Oct 2012 - Nov 2022.. Dating, lived with then married and then divorced
Leala Sep 2023-Present.  Dating(or seeing each other behind Paul's back) then Married in June of 2025.  Paul died dec 10, 2024.

So that's my love and family life.
I spent most of the beginning of my career as a Unix guy. I was into System Administration, Network Administration, building systems for AT&T Bell Labs. Then Bell Labs split into AT&T Labs we started down the path of integrating windows in the workplace. I was into Coldfusion, utlizing HP OpenView and Remedy with other tools to actually take System and Network Administration into a different age. OpenView and it's tools would monitor the system, report the trouble, then display on a board. It would open a ticket in the Remedy System, and using Cold Fusion I set up a tracking system. I coded, designed and implemented the system for the Client Support HelpDesk using a variety of API's, tools and vendors and used RUP to track the project as a whole. After this was said and done, I moved to AT&T Local Systems, where I grew to love EDI and the transactions between AT&T, BellSouth and other Vendors. I worked with external Vendors such as Sprint, MCI, BellSouth and other LEC's. I also worked with Lawyers on different tariff disputes and processes.I went on to become a Senior Consultant with Elite Systems. This was exciting and fun and I grew in the Enterprise Architecture with the NEWer technologies. The bleeding edge of the early 2000's. DotNet became my primary selection but I still used what I needed to get the job done. Never fully tying myself to any one except the baseline of DOTNET, and I generally am a C# guy there because of my background in UNIX, Java and so on. That does not mean I do not know VB or VB.NET. 

I work in a Devops role, dealing with all different types of technology. working with containerization platforms such as Kubernetes, Openshift, Gke, Docker, VMware and AWS.

Kevin is a great senior developer and an effortless tech leader. He has a rare depth and breadth of experience. Yes, he has the long, successful track record of interpreting business needs to deliver timely tech results. But Kevin goes beyond these accomplishments. He starts by bringing strong fundamentals to his work and his team, including honesty, respect, commitment and a sense of humor that helps every implementation. He always exhibits concern for others and goes out of his way to help others including helping others gain opportunities. He participates in highly technical "developer dialogs" without effort and as an obvious leader. He works directly with Customers showing them his grasp of their needs and a focus on delivering. When you realize that Kevin's development expertise includes experience at the innovative Bell Labs. And that he has delivered systems on virtually every major technology stack out there today. When you see him approach and resolve need after business need. I think you're close to understanding how Kevin is a rare and valuable asset to our company today. And that he will be a leader for us into the future. From my more immediate personal perspective, Kevin is a great developer to work with and I am lucky to be able to work beside him here at CareMedic. I learn from Kevin daily (and I've been around a long time, too). I know that I can totally rely on Kevin and any team he's on. Finally, I have to mention that Kevin is also one of that rare breed, from back in the day: a consummate, full-spectrum "Web Master". A designer, with a great eye, as well as a hardcore technologist, keeping the massive clusters humming. These guys are worth their weight in bail-out money these days, though don't tell them I said so.
